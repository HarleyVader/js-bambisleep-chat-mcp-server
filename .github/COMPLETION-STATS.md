## Technical Debt & Notes

### Current Blockers

- None (project not started)

### Architectural Decisions Made

- Using monorepo structure with separate server/agent packages
- Planning to use Express for HTTP server (Koa as alternative)
- SQLite for local development database
- Socket.io for real-time communication with SSE fallback

### Future Considerations

- Consider implementing monitoring and metrics after Week 6
- Plan for advanced contract testing for docking protocol
- Performance optimization for tool execution
- Security hardening review
- Comprehensive API documentation
